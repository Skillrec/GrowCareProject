A project thats enable a connection to an [VegTrug Sensor](https://www.amazon.de/Xiaomi-Flower-Care-Bodenfruchtbarkeit-Feuchtigkeitsgrad/dp/B078VQSYN3) and is able to fetch the data of it.

## Concept Description

The idea behind it is that you can install multiple Sensor in your Home which are connect to different Bluetooth and wifi devices,like the Raspberry PI.
So you have a network where every device is connect to a server with a database, because of the low range of Bluetooth itself, you need multi devices.
